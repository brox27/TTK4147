/*
Fork will make a copy of the process. An independent copy of the process. So, if a global variable contains 3 at the time you fork, each copy of the process gets their very own 3. 
And if they modify,their modifications are completely independent.
*/

/*
vfork() is an obsolete optimization. Before good memory management, fork() made a full copy of the parent's memory, so it was pretty expensive. since in many cases a fork()
was followed by exec(), which discards the current memory map and creates a new one, it was a needless expense. Nowadays, fork() doesn't copy the memory; 
it's simply set as "copy on write", so fork()+exec() is just as efficient as vfork()+exec().
